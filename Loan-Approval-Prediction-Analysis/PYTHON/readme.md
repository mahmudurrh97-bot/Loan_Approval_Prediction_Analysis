# Loan Approval Dataset - Notebook Summary  

This Jupyter Notebook (`loan_approval_dataset.ipynb`) contains the end-to-end preprocessing and feature engineering of a loan approval dataset, aimed at preparing clean and enriched data for further analysis or machine learning applications.  

## Contents  

- **Data Preparation:**  
  - Importing required Python libraries.  
  - Loading and describing the dataset.  
  - Cleaning and handling missing or inconsistent values.  

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Addition of **CIBIL rating** column.  
  - Creation of **income level** categories.  
  - Derivation of **loan amount rating** column.  
  - Addition of **loan term** classification.  
  - Introduction of **dependent** column for customer dependents.  

- **Data Export:**  
  - Saving the cleaned and modified dataset as a new CSV file.  

## Key Insights  

- Dataset transformed into a **clean and structured format** suitable for modeling.  
- Multiple new **derived features** (CIBIL, income levels, loan ratings, etc.) enhance predictive power.  
- Provides a strong foundation for **loan approval prediction models** or advanced analytics.  

This notebook creates a reproducible workflow for preparing raw loan approval data into a **feature-rich dataset** ready for analysis and machine learning.
